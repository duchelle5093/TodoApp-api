## Features

- **Task Management:** Create, update, retrieve (with optional filtering by status), and delete tasks.
- **Optimistic Locking:** Uses a version field to prevent concurrent update issues.
- **Swagger API Documentation:** Easily explore and test the API endpoints using the integrated Swagger UI.
- **Clean Architecture:** Structured using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Lombok for maintainability and clarity.

## Technology Stack

- **Java:** 17 or higher
- **Spring Boot:** REST API development
- **Spring Data JPA:** Database interactions
- **Lombok:** Reducing boilerplate code in model classes
- **Springdoc OpenAPI:** API documentation (Swagger UI)
- **Database:** Postgresql

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later installed
- Maven (or use the Maven Wrapper provided)
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation & Setup


2. **Build the project using Maven:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run

## API Documentation

- The applicationâ€™s API documentation is automatically generated with Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger). After starting the application, open your browser and visit:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- This interactive documentation allows you to explore and test every endpoint directly from your browser.

## API Endpoints

- Below is an overview of the primary endpoints exposed by the API:

1. **Create a Task**

- **Endpoint:** POST /api/tasks
- **Description:** Creates a new task.
- **Request Body Example:** 

   ```Json
  {
   "title": "Buy groceries",
  "description": "Milk, eggs, bread",
  "status": "TODO"
   }

2. **Retrieve Tasks**

- **Endpoint:** GET /api/tasks
- **Description:** Returns all tasks. You can optionally filter tasks by status.
- **Request Body Example:** status (optional; values: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE)

3. **Update a Task**

- **Endpoint:** PUT /api/tasks/{id}
- **Description:** Updates an existing task. You can modify the title, description, or status.
- **Request Body Example:**

   ```Json
   {
    "title": "Buy groceries and supplies",
    "description": "Milk, eggs, bread, and cleaning supplies",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
   }

## Optimistic Locking

This project uses optimistic locking to handle concurrent updates to a task. A version field in the Task entity prevents data conflicts by ensuring that any update operation is based on the most recent version of the entity.

## Testing

- You can test the API endpoints using:
- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- **Postman** or any similar API client.

- To run the tests (if provided):

   ```bash
   mvn test
